# Cameras

Connecting cameras is easy, but only some cameras work. We need to camera to either support PTP (usually mid priced amateur cameras and above), or be a standard USB webcam. 

If the camera is a webcam, we can use a program called fswebcam to take an image.

If the camera supports PTP then we can use gphoto2 to take the image. If the camera supports it, gphoto2 can adjust settings like exposure or aperture settings

# Connections

* plug the camera into the Pi's USB socket
